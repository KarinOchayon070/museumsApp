# museumsApp

Hi!

This is our final project in "GIS" course.
In this project we flavored a map, and allowed the user to search and filter museums according to category, radius, city, price, rating,
area, weekends opening and by specific name!

An explanatory video on YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBYe9MLp1BU&ab_channel=KarinOchayon.

Enjoy :)
